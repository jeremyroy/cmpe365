Lab exercises 1
</h3>
<center>
	Must be uploaded at the end of your lab in Week 2<br>
</center>
<p>
Each week's lab assumes that you are familiar with the course material
up to the end of the previous week. So you need to make sure that you
go over what we talk about in class not too long after each class.
<p>
These exercises are designed to be done in the lab, where there's a TA to help
you. However, you should not walk into the lab cold -- you need to spend
some time reading the lab questions and wrapping your mind around what's
to be done ahead of time. 
It's useful to have some paper you can scribble on beside you.
<p>
The deliverable from each lab is a Word document that answers the questions,
shows that you've done the work, and understand what you've been doing;
and the code that you've written (which can be in separate files).
Don't get hung up on formatting, but spare a thought for the TAs who
have to read a lot of these and try to lay the content out so that it's
clear.
Recall that the PrtScr (print screen) button copies the entire desktop 
view to the clipboard, while Alt-PrtScr copies only the active window.
<p>
The emphasis in this course is on the algorithms themselves, but you
should write the highest quality code that you can, including documentation
where necessary, especially when you are doing something tricky or clever.
Remember that TAs are looking at a lot of lab solutions, so help them
out.
<p>
The lab room is open during the day, so you can, of course, come and work
on the exercises at other times, for example starting early.
<p>
All work that you hand in must be done by you. You can ask
other people questions, especially the TAs, but the work must be your
own.
<p>
You may find it convenient to bring a USB key to the lab so that
you can keep copies of the files you use and generate. If you don't
you might like to email yourself a copy of the results file so that
you have a record of it.
<p>
This lab focuses on the best employee problem. In particular, it asks
you to write code to check that the claimed properties really are
true.
<p>
I have provided a set of 1000 scores drawn from a uniform random
distribution, and 1000 scores drawn from an exponential distribution
for you to use as test data (us*.csv for the uniform, es*.csv for
the exponential).
These are provided in several permuted orders
so you can test the algorithm (i.e they are the same set of random
values, but in different orders).
<p>
Now here are the activities to do:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Download the datasets and put them in a sensible place.
<p>
<li>
Write code to find the best score in each of the datasets by looking
at all of the entries, so that you know the right answers.
<p>
<li>
Write code that implements the best employee algorithm we discussed
in class.
Run it with all of the datasets.
<p>
<li>
Write some text analysing your results. Does you algorithm find the best
employee? Do the different distributions make a difference?
<p>
<li>
If you have time, you might try and write code to display the values
in order using some sort of graphic. This will make it much more
obvious why your algorithm gets the results it does, and will come in
useful for labs that build on this one.
</ol>
<p>
Save your Word document so that you have a copy.
Upload it in Onq to the right place for your lab group. 
Choose a helpful file name such as beavisbuttheadlab1.doc.
<p>
Make sure you have copies of everything you worked on either saved on
your usb key or emailed to both of you.
You're done for this week.
