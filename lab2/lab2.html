Lab exercises 1

	Must be uploaded at the end of your lab in Week 3<br>
</center>
<p>
<p>
The deliverable from this lab is a Word document that answers the questions,
shows that you've done the work, and understand what you've been doing;
and the code that you've written (which can be in separate files).
Don't get hung up on formatting, but spare a thought for the TAs who
have to read a lot of these and try to lay the content out so that it's
clear.
Recall that the PrtScr (print screen) button copies the entire desktop 
view to the clipboard, while Alt-PrtScr copies only the active window.
<p>
The emphasis in this course is on the algorithms themselves, but you
should write the highest quality code that you can, including documentation
where necessary, especially when you are doing something tricky or clever.
Remember that TAs are looking at a lot of lab solutions, so help them
out.
<p>
All work that you hand in must be done by you. You can ask
other people questions, especially the TAs, but the work must be your
own.
<p>
Labs are worth 5 marks each, and marks are integers. 
The standard mark for a lab well done is
4/5. Labs are designed to be open-ended and encourage you to explore.
The mark of 5/5 is reserved for those who do something interesting
beyond the core of each lab, or for those whose presentation displays
a sophisticated understanding of the work (or both).
<p>
This lab focuses on the Collatz program.
Recall that it is believed (but hasn't been proved) that this loop with
terminate when it is started with any positive integer value for x.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
You may recall the process for finding all of the prime numbers smaller
than a given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The algorithm starts
from small integers and crosses off all of its multiples which cannot,
of course, be prime.
<p>
We will use a similar idea to check all of the possible starting integers
smaller than a given value for the Collatz problem.
Suppose I want to check all of the starting integers smaller than 100. As I
execute the loop, x starts out at 100, but its value jumps around
other values, some less than 100 and some greater. Eventually (I happen
to know) it reaches 1 and the loop stops.
<p>
Now if I want to check x starting at 99, as the values jump around they
may reach a value that has previously been seen during the calculation
starting from 100. If this happens, then we know right away that the
loop will terminate, so we don't need to do the rest of the calculation.
<p>
Implement this idea by keeping a list, initially 0s, that gets values
set if it is ever visited by one run of the Collatz program. Use it to
check the Collatz conjecture for all starting points 1 to n, for some
large n.
<p>
Of course, we don't know how long to make this list. Investigate
how large intermediate values of x tend to be, as a function of the 
starting value. Does it matter if we don't use a full list, for
example only storing values up to the initial value of x, or
perhaps twice that?
<p>
<li>
If you have time, experiment with whether this saves, on average, any
time by comparing it to a straightforward implementation that doesn't
save information from previous runs.
<p>
<li>
If you have time, investigate whether there are any patterns of how
x converges to its final value of 1. Do intermediate values have any
structure? Do different runs preferentially reach previous values, or
is it uniform? Does every terminating run also pass through x = 2?
<p>
</ol>
<p>
Save your Word document so that you have a copy.
<b>Include your name in the file names you upload, and upload the report
and the code in two separate files</b>.
<p>
Make sure you have copies of everything you worked on either saved on
your usb key or emailed to both of you.
You're done for this week.
