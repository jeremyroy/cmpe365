Lab exercises 3

	Must be uploaded at the end of your lab in Week 4<br>
</center>
<p>
<p>
The deliverable from this lab is a Word document that answers the questions,
shows that you've done the work, and understand what you've been doing;
and the code that you've written (in separate files).
Don't get hung up on formatting, but spare a thought for the TAs who
have to read a lot of these and try to lay the content out so that it's
clear.
Recall that the PrtScr (print screen) button copies the entire desktop 
view to the clipboard, while Alt-PrtScr copies only the active window.
<p>
The emphasis in this course is on the algorithms themselves, but you
should write the highest quality code that you can, including documentation
where necessary, especially when you are doing something tricky or clever.
Remember that TAs are looking at a lot of lab solutions, so help them
out.
<p>
All work that you hand in must be done by you. You can ask
other people questions, especially the TAs, but the work must be your
own.
<p>
This lab focuses on a version of the Best Employee problem that has
sometimes been called the UAV problem, or the Holiday photos problem.
<p>
<b>Problem</b>
<p>
Suppose that you have a UAV flying over a foreign country, and you want
it to take pictures of anything interesting it sees. Because of limited
storage space it can only keep a small fraction of the images its cameras
take, so the question is: which ones to keep?
<p>
To make this a bit more concrete, let's suppose that you have space
to keep <i>k</i> images (a parameter to your algorithm), and the
camera system can
compute 10 binary values for each image, which provide information about
the kinds of things it contains. So there might be a bit for buildings,
a bit for water, a bit for missile launchers, a bit for roads, a
bit for runways, and so on. Images that contain (lots of) these things
are interesting, but you also want the set of images to be as variable
as possible. So the function that computes how interesting an image
is can't just depend on how many bits are set in the current image;
it must depend both on what images have already been seen and, in
a sense, on what else might still be seen.
<p>
A useful distance function for binary data is called <i>Hamming
distance</i> -- the distance between two binary records is the number
of places in which their entries differ.
<p>
You will find a set of 1000 'images' (i.e. sets of 10 binary values)
in the file images.csv.
An obvious way to attack this problem is to compare each new image to
the best k seen so far, and replace one of them by the new one if it's
far from all of them.
<p>
Build an implementation of this idea. 
You'll have to decide whether you want to keep the best k images so
far in a sorted order, and you'll have to initialise this list with
the first k images. Note that you'll have to keep track of which
images they are because this is the final output of your program.
<p>
How well does your algorithm do? As a
way to answer this, the file coords.csv contains 2-dimensional
coordinates for each image (in a space where the 10 dimensions have
been projected down to 2). Show a plot of your k final images
using their coordinates taken from this file (they should be nicely
spread out). In other words, if original image 43 is in your set
of k, you can plot a point at the coordinate position from row 43
of the coordinates file.
<p>
There is no <b>right answer</b> so you'll have to argue why your
answer is good.
<p>
Experiment with choosing different values of k.
<p>
Now think about ways you might improve the basic algorithm. Does
the pattern of distances from the current set of images contain other
information you can leverage?
<p>
Talk about your results and issues in your report.
<p>
Save your Word document so that you have a copy.
<b>Include your name in the file names you upload, and upload the report
and the code in two separate files</b>.
<p>
Make sure you have copies of everything you worked on either saved on
your usb key or emailed to yourself. You're done for this week.
